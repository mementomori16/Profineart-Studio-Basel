    "detailsSection": {
      "title": "Program content and technical mastery",
       "text": "<h5>Foundational Drawing and Composition</h5><p>Traditional drawing is the heart of oil painting. Sometimes the drawing is created during the oil painting process. This requires a high level of mastery which we will cover during the course. You will learn to command form and proportion using various sources: photographs, old masters, or live studio setups. We may work on still life, live models, or 'en plein air' sessions to capture landscapes and figures under the open sky.</p><h5>The Art of the Underpainting</h5><p>You will master the technique of the initial sketch using charcoal, pastel, graphite, egg tempera, acrylic, or oil. This stage simplifies the entire painting process and can often stand alone as a finished work or serve as the vital structural map for your layers.</p><h5>Canvas and Surface Preparation</h5><p>You will learn the professional art of surface preparation: stretching canvases (linen, cotton, or synthetic) and understanding thread weight. We study the critical link between glues and gesso—including gypsum, acrylic, and oil-based primers—and how they directly influence the vibrancy, gloss, and archival quality of your work.</p><h5>Advanced Application and Multi-Layering</h5><p>We explore the spectrum from 'Alla Prima' to complex glazing (layering). You will learn to use specialized soft brushes for airy tones and fine details in portraits and drapery. We study the chemistry of oils—such as linseed and walnut—and which varieties are suited for hyper-realism versus large-scale works. You will also master the use of the maulstick and final varnishing to protect and highlight specific details.</p><h3>Artistic and Philosophical Heritage</h3><p>Mastering oil painting is an immersion into the primary language of fine art that has dominated the global market for centuries. In contemporary art, deep command of oils sets an artist apart, offering a level of material depth and prestige valued by galleries and collectors. This course provides the technical mastery to move between hyper-realism and expressive abstraction. By controlling every variable—from the hand-primed canvas to the final varnish—you ensure your work possesses the archival integrity and visual power required for museum-level exhibitions and elite private commissions.</p><h3>Format and Logistics</h3><p>The training is conducted as private individual sessions with the teacher traveling to the student's home for maximum comfort and efficiency. You choose your package of 1, 5, or 10 lessons. Note that all necessary materials and equipment are not included in the session cost.

This course rejects stencils in favor of developing a true biological 'handwriting.' You will learn to hold the hand correctly, creating effortless circles and fluid lines that form the skeleton of any great work. This process enhances spatial imagination and fine motor coordination, allowing for creative freedom that mechanical aids cannot provide.</p><h5>Material Science and Specialized Media</h5><p>You will gain a professional understanding of the interaction between media and substrate. We study diverse paper types tailored for graphite, charcoal, and pastel. The curriculum covers the taxonomy of graphite grades, professional methods for sharpening lead cores, and the correct use of various erasers, blending stumps (tortillions), and fixative varnishes. We also introduce the sophisticated 'Dry Brush' technique, bridging the gap between drawing and painting.</p><h5>Anatomical Foundation and Texture</h5><p>Anatomy is the most vital pillar of graphics. We focus on the realistic forms of the human body, providing the necessary base for any future work in color. You will master the 'stroke'—learning to control line thickness and density. Beyond graphite, we explore the deep blacks of natural and compressed charcoal and the vibrant layering of soft and hard pastels to create professional-grade textures.</p><h3>Artistic and Philosophical Heritage</h3><p>Mastering freehand drawing is a profound cognitive exercise that builds a direct connection between perception and execution. Unlike tracing, which limits you to a single form, freehand drawing allows you to evolve the image as you work. This course transforms the student from a craftsman into an artist with a signature style, providing a technical foundation that is respected in both classical galleries and modern design industries.</p><h3>Format and Logistics</h3><p>The training is conducted as private individual sessions with the teacher traveling to the student's home for maximum comfort and efficiency.

    "description": "<h3>The Program Focus</h3><p>Painting on stone is both one of the oldest and most contemporary forms of self-expression. Unlike a flat canvas, <u>stone is a three-dimensional, eternal object</u> that challenges the artist to work with its unique shape, weight, and geological history.</p><h2>Questions You Will Answer</h2><h5>The Heritage of Stone</h5><p>How did our ancestors use ochre and charcoal to create sacred petroglyphs in caves like Altamira? What are the secrets of the 16th-century masters, like Sebastiano del Пьомбо, who used the <u>natural veins of marble and slate</u> to mimic clouds and waves?</p><h5>Modern Fine Art vs. Craft</h5><p>How to transition from simple decorative pebbles to 'High Art'? We explore the works of modern masters who transform stones into hyper-realistic animals or surreal conceptual objects.</p><h5>Technical Durability</h5><p>How do you ensure that paint <u>never chips, cracks, or fades</u>? We will master the layering techniques necessary for the stone to be handled freely and remain an 'ultimate' durable art object.</p><h5>The Philosophy of Form</h5><p>How can a crack, depression, or the natural contour of a rock become a vital part of your composition?

We cover materials that allow you to level uneven surfaces or create a specific texture over the stone, ensuring professional paint adhesion on even the 'slickest' minerals.</p><h5>Miniature and Multi-Layer Painting</h5><p>Working on stone often involves miniature painting, requiring extreme patience and precision. You will master the <u>sequential application of layers</u> using various media: Oil, Acrylic, Tempera, or even Watercolor. This process includes detailed sketching and building volume through glazing, similar to classical iconography and academic drawing.</p><h5>3D Thinking and Problem Solving</h5><p>The course develops <u>'volumetric' thinking</u>. Unlike a flat sheet of paper, a stone requires you to account for a 360-degree view and a non-linear surface. This skill is essential for solving complex artistic problems related to irregular shapes and three-dimensional textures.</p><h3>Artistic and Philosophical Heritage</h3><p>Mastering stone painting provides a powerful foundation for <u>design and construction</u>. The patience and precision gained here are directly applicable to other irregular objects and modern industries. In the future, students can apply these skills in <b>Architectural Decor</b> (customizing marble or granite interiors), <b>Jewelry Design</b> (miniatures on semi-precious gems), and <b>Game Development</b>—where a deep understanding of geological textures and light interaction is vital for realistic 3D texturing. This course transforms a simple natural element into a sophisticated medium for conceptual and narrative art.</p><h3>Format and Logistics</h3><p>The training is conducted as private individual sessions with the teacher traveling to the student's home for maximum comfort and efficiency.

  "description": "<h3>The Program Focus</h3><p>Does contemporary art require skill, or is it just ideas? This course proves that the strongest modern artists are masters of tradition. We explore painting as a visceral act of gesture and drama, moving far beyond mechanical copying or simple illustration.</p><h2>Questions You Will Answer</h2><h5>The Reality of Style</h5><p>What defines the line between Hyperrealism and Magical Realism? Why does modern painting value 'unfinished' edges and visible drips alongside extreme precision?</p><h5>Market and Meaning</h5><p>How do you distinguish 'High Art' from Kitsch? Is your work a commercial product or a museum-level masterpiece?</p><h5>The Power of Tradition</h5><p>How do we use history as a toolkit rather than a cage? Why is the mastery of the human form still the ultimate weapon of the contemporary painter?</p>",

    "text": "<h5>The Modern Alchemy of Paint</h5><p>You will master the physical 'event' of painting: from <b>Alla Prima</b> and heavy impasto to the sophisticated secrets of multi-layered <b>Glazing</b>. We focus on 'psychological likeness' rather than just photographic accuracy.</p><h5>Deconstructing the Masters</h5><p>Learn to 'hack' the methods of the greats to build your own signature style. We explore how to balance technical perfection with the courage to destroy and reinvent a canvas, losing the fear of the 'spoiled' work in favor of raw expression.</p><h5>The Technical Base</h5><p>We cover the essential physics of oil painting: from surface preparation and underpainting to the chemistry of mediums. This course provides the structural foundation required for museum-level exhibitions and professional gallery representation.</p><h3>Format and Logistics</h3><p>Private individual sessions conducted at the student's home for maximum efficiency. Choose a package of 1, 5, or 10 lessons. Materials are not included. Lessons are available in Basel, Basel-Landschaft, and neighboring suburbs of Germany and France.</p>"}

  "standardDurationText": "<h3>Course Duration and Individual Pace</h3><p>The full curriculum is structured as a comprehensive path of 40 double sessions or 80 academic hours, which includes the student's essential self-work. However, as these are private individual sessions, the total time required to master the material is flexible; it adapts entirely to your personal progress, artistic background, and the time you dedicate to practice. There are no rigid deadlines and no grades; the focus is exclusively on your individual mastery of the craft and the quality of your artistic development.</p>"

He was also my tattoo artist; he helped me break into the industry, mentored me, and gave me the courage to get started. Today, I am the proud owner of my own tattoo business ❤️"

    "text": "Lessons with you were an enriching experience, combining rigorous step-by-step learning without compromising on quality, while maintaining a sense of perfection and correct methodology. We started from the basics—preparing the canvas, measuring and understanding proportions, and acrylic underpainting—leading up to the highlight: oil painting. I am currently working on portraits of my family members from photos. You have definitely given me a solid foundation for my work, and I hope the results you see do not disappoint you."

    "text": "I arrived about two years ago with almost zero experience and many fears. I quickly realized I was in the right hands. You are a patient, attentive, and kind teacher, with a rare ability to explain complex principles simply and clearly without pressure. You knew exactly when to guide, when to correct, and when to let me experiment. I especially appreciated your insistence that I do everything myself—particularly the difficult corrections—so that in the end, the painting is entirely 'mine,' giving me a huge sense of pride. This was an empowering experience both artistically and personally. I previously studied with different teachers, but your teaching was honest, enriching, and filled with true faith in art. You ensured we knew other artists and always brought examples from the masters to support your instructions. Thank you for the journey and the belief in me."
